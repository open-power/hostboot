            States of N-Mode declaration for the PMICs on a 4U DIMM.
            The bit would be set high if GPIO or PMIC setup reported a
            failure relating to that part. If two PMICs in a redundant pair have declared
            N-Mode, then the DIMM can not be enabled.

            The bits are as follows: [PMIC0, PMIC1, PMIC2, PMIC3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
            Bit high = N-Mode declared, or PMIC was not identified as PRESENT

            Force one of 4 N-Mode configurations instead of N_PLUS_1 mode.
            The bits are as follows: [PMIC0, PMIC1, PMIC2, PMIC3, 0, 0, 0, 0]
            Set the bits high for the desired PMICs to run with. A valid configuration
            to boot with is at least a pair with one each of [0,2] and [1,3].
            This only applies to 4U DDIMMs.
