            Percentage to increase/decrease MEM frequency - two's complement number.
            Measured in 100's.  So the value of 100 is one percent increase.
            This frequency change comes from changing multipliers and dividers to  get the desired frequency.
            The supported frequencies come from Tim Diemoz.
            Creator: platform set this to 0.  Users can set this to a valid value.
            VALID Values: (TBD % to TBD %) (Tuleta) (TBD % to TBD %) (Glacier)

            A bit vector (per Dean's request) specifying if a DIMM is functional.
            DIMM attributes, such as SIZE, are qualified by this bit vector.
            The attribute ANDed 0x80 means port 0, DIMM 0 is functional, 0x40 means port 0, DIMM 1 is functional.
            0x08 means port 1, DIMM 0 is functional and 0x04 means port 1 DIMM 1 is functional.
            A fully populated system would have the value of 0xCC.

            Byte-for-byte override for the bucket of data that would
            normally come from SPD.  If ATTR_SPD_OVERRIDE_ENABLE!=0 then
            the value of this attribute will be returned to callers of
            fapi2::getSPD() instead of the actual SPD contents.
