#   From "git help githooks" :
#   "This hook executes once for the receive operation. It takes no arguments, 
#       but for each ref to be updated it receives on standard input a line of 
#       the format:
#
#       <old-value> SP <new-value> SP <ref-name> LF
#
#       where <old-value> is the old object name stored in the ref, 
#       <new-value> is the new object name to be stored in the ref, 
#       and <ref-name> is the full name of the ref. 
#       When creating a new ref, <old-value> is 40 0."
